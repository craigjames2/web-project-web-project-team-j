I get that. Like anything else that becomes trendy, people become involved for the wrong reasons. For some perspective, I've had to dissociate from SJW culture because I agree that in many cases those kinds of spaces are just self-serving echo chambers. I have a good friend who phrased it well, she said that \"when people who have been denied any kind of real power their whole life suddenly feel like they have power, they can lose their way and turn into real shitty people.\" All this said, when I first started educating myself about many of the issues in the public sphere right now and became involved in those spaces they absolutely transformed my life in a positive way. When done right, they facilitate open and honest dialogue if people approach them with modesty and a willingness to challenge their preconceptions. \n\nTrigger warnings for trigger warnings are excessive, I agree--but what's inherently wrong with the idea of a trigger warning? It doesn't even have to be explicitly stated--a simple, \"hey we're gonna talk about some fucked up shit that some of you may find uncomfortable\" is perfectly fine. What bothers me is this notion that the far-right has which assumes that trigger warnings are a means of avoiding things that make us uncomfortable, and that's just simply not the case. \n\nAs far as 4chan's /pol/, my experience has been entirely different. I'm black, and in every case I've mentioned that I'm overwhelmed by a flood of people who completely disregard everything I'm saying just to throw racial slurs my way. /pol/ is the most obvious example of an echo chamber I can think of, the people there cherry pick information that suits their ideology and make ad-hom attacks against anyone who goes against the grain regardless of the quality of information they're presenting. Even when I don't mention my race, or pretend to be white (and it's fucked up that I have to do that to be taken seriously), users refuse to engage with my arguments fully. They'll pick a single point in my position and collectively throw the same recycled arguments at it, ignoring the rest of my post. This is the small minority of those who actually try to engage, the vast majority just flame me. I've had people refuse to even look at data (by their own admission) because it's \"libtard propoganda\". In literally every instance I've been banned or the thread has been prematurely archived. I have had one single positive encounter on /pol/ in a debate about genetic differences between races, and even then the person who actually presented a decent argument just stopped responding when I pointed out some inconsistencies in their position...and then I was banned. \n\nPerhaps your experience there is different because you identify with more of their beliefs, and they're less inclined to treat you like shit?\n\nI also want to add that in all of the years I've been involved with social justice, I don't know anyone serious (who actually does work) who gives a flying fuck about sites like geekfeminism or any of that shit. This is actually my first time even hearing about that specific site. A lot of the stuff the right latches onto to attack leftists are generalizations that are more descriptive of the college undergrads who are just learning about this stuff and trying to be edgy than those who've been involved for years and have a grounded, practical analysis. Not to put those people down, we all start somewhere. But everyone starts in a different place and we all have different levels of experience, and many of the folks you might be surrounded by at a college campus don't necessarily represent all of the radical left. I can't emphasize this enough--liberals have co-opted and corporatized social justice efforts for years, the generic \"Mcdonald's SJW\" rhetoric you might be familiar with on the news is not representative at all of the efforts I'm familiar with.\n\nAnyways, I just wanted to vent here. I've been trying to engage with people on /pol/ and here for weeks with no luck, and it's beyond frustrating. I just can't believe some of the things I've seen encouraged by these people, and now that they feel emboldened I'm actually worried about my safety. Just the other day I was at a gas station (everyone there is black) and some white guys in a truck drove by and screamed, \"fuck you niggers\" while we were pumping gas. My sister has received hundreds of calls at her workplace from white people saying she should be lynched, burned alive, or that she should kill herself. This is because of her public activism that they disagree with. Fuck that, if I can't pump my gas in peace and my own sister can't even go to work to make an honest living because some right-wingers are having a violent and emotional response to something they disagree with, then I feel OK demanding a \"safe space\" where I can be with my people without fear of judgment or physical harm. Call it what you want.\n\nBut if you want to talk about anything specific, I'm all ears--feel free to shoot me a message. I honestly prefer having these kinds of conversations with people who have a different perspective than those who just mindlessly agree about bullshit because it's politically correct. We're all in the same boat, and frankly I think the right and the left are concerned about many of the same issues--but we have very different beliefs about the root causes of these issues.

As a straight man, engaging with feminism has certainly challenged me, but I consider that healthy. In many ways it's been liberating. Feminism isn't just for women, when you really get down into the nitty gritty of it (which might require some effort, y'know, actually reading a book or two that you might not otherwise) it's pretty to clear me that it's just as much about addressing the issues that men face as women. \n\nI think you hit the nail on the head in saying these things have been hijacked, but I think the difference is that most critical thinkers can distinguish between grounded radical analysis and the corporate liberal SJW garbage that's been thrown around the past few years.

{"body":"There are different kinds of safe spaces. In a lot of cases, they could be as a simple as a classroom. Anyone is allowed there, but the idea is that the entire class can talk about difficult issues like racism or gender inequality without anyone jumping down anyone elses throat because of disagreement. \n\nAs far as spaces that don't allow certain groups, yeah I hear you. But there are leftist groups of specifically white people who hold spaces just for white people to talk about issues of race. There are spaces for just men to talk about gender issues, just as there are for women. Different groups of people face different challenges, and so it makes sense that in many cases those groups of people need to process and work through those things together. There's nothing wrong with acknowledging our differences. The right loves to hammer this mantra, yet doesn't seem to find it acceptable when the left does it.\n\nYou wouldn't go an AA or veterans meeting if you're not actually an alcoholic or you aren't a veteran, because you have wildly different experiences. You wouldn't go attend a meeting for survivors of sexual assault if you yourself have never been sexually assaulted. Likewise, white people don't experience racism in the same way as black people, and black people don't experience it the same way that brown people do. Men and women experience gender inequality in very different ways, as do cis and trans people, straight and gay people, the list could go on. \n\nThat's not to say that we don't all experience these things and that we shouldn't work together, but it's also important to be able to process specific issues with others who have similar experiences that you can relate to. \n\nMe comparing internet boards to a safe space alludes more to the first example, as a place where people can have civil dialogue about critical issues without feeling like they're being censored. From what I understand, that is kind of the whole notion of places like /pol/. /r/The_Donald is more oriented towards their candidate, so that isn't really comparable to a safe space, but /pol/ serves as a gathering place for people to talk about these issues without being censored by what they perceive as political correctness (and I can empathize with that, really). The basic idea is the same--\"let's have a place where we can freely express our opinions even if they are unpopular and make some people uncomfortable.\"\n\nI don't really disagree with what you're saying about trigger warnings. That was basically what I was saying, but my argument is that just because some people hijacked the term we shouldn't throw the baby out with the bathwater, as many on the right tend to do. And to add to that, I think most people associate PTSD exclusively with military combat and other forms of physical violence--but it's important to recognize that PTSD is diagnosed for a lot of things and trauma comes in many forms. I won't deny that this fact has been abused to generalize any sort of discomfort as \"PTSD\", which is bullshit and I agree, but again why throw out the baby with the bathwater? \n\nAnd I think it's important to acknowledge that a combat veteran deals with a very different kind of PTSD than someone who might experience it in other forms, and visa-versa. They don't invalidate eachother, but they are clearly different; again indicating that it's important to have safe spaces for people who experience things in different ways.

You can hope that the person you select to drive you is well versed in the roads, and customs of where you are going, but in the end you are not driving the car, the person you selected is. \nThe worst thing you can do is simply get in the taxi without voicing where you are going and getting mad about it.\n\nI, personally, think that voting isn't a right, isn't a duty, isn't a responsibility, because these can all be neglected. I think voting is a necessity, it is a mandate. Part of that mandate is to educate one's self about who is on the field, and what their options are, but telling someone to not vote isn't an option, in my opinion. Telling someone to not vote slowly kills a democracy. \n\nYes there is a heavy burden on those that we put in power to serve the people of any nation.

Too bad you did choose a Europeen to discuss Europeen politics.\n\n&gt; Italy will pass a huge constitutional reform effectively making it right wing\n\nThat \"right-wing\" refrom you talk about, is actually a referendum to be held and it was introduced by Matteo Renzi, a politican of the Democratic Party. It's center, left-leaning and will mostly reform the constitution, with a strong emphasis on the supreme court so a Berlusconi can't happen again. The whole proposal is threw and threw liberal.\n\nAfter Berlusconi, the italien political sphere has moved more and more left. They even had one of the first technocrat gouverments.\n\n&gt; France will elect LePenn (right wing)\n\nLePenn is literally the only canidate that would loose against Hollande. Nicolas Sarkozy would crush her, since they have the same voterbase. \n\n&gt; Merkel will lose her power and there are strong right wing alternatives\n\nAre you kindding me? Do you have any remote idea how Germany elects it's chancellor?\n\nWe elect our Parlement, then the Gourvenment Party is selected, or we form a coalition. After that they elect the chancellor.\nRight now we have the \"Big coalition\", with 75%. Most likely we'll have that next year aswell, so another time Merkel. \n\nThe \"strong right wing alternative(s)\" is the AfD, and not a single party is ready to form a gouverment with them. Especially not the Conservative Union. The only canidate that might get big enough to form a coallition is the Green party - The Union and SPD said they were interested. \n\n&gt; Spain is becoming increasingly right wing \n\nUhm, in the last general elections the 3 main parties, PP, PSOE and Unidos Podemos were Christ Conservative, social-democratic and very much left-wing. They all have rising populatity and together they make up 70% of all votes.\n\n&gt; because of current elections.  Should I go on? \n\nYou think that Europe welcomes Trump? xD Don't be an idiot xD Please, it's very entertaining.\n\n&gt; It's a losing battle, man. (...)  I don't like nationalism. I think it's cancer.\n\nCoward.\n\n&gt; Frankly, it just means you are disconnected from the rest of the simple people that have needs that can be addressed with nationalistic reforms.\n\nOh really? I, a german student, living from 700\u20ac a month in the center of the \"refugee crisis\" don't understand the needs of the \"simple people\". Go on, tell me more.\n\nYou could actually adress the problems, like we do here. Or you just sit in the corner crying \" WE CAN'T FIGHT THE CANCER.\" \n\n&gt; we must embrace why it's happening\n\nDo you rememnber what I said?  \"The question is, why, not how.\" Thank you for the endorsement.\n\n&gt; and understand it happens all the time as it's cyclic.\n\nIt's not. Cyclic would mean it occurs in fixed time intervals, that's not the case. The higher of a living standart in a country, the stronger is the trend away from extremes. The lower the education standart, the more Populists can succeed. It's not that hard to grasp. The problem in the US is the big divide in the population when it comes to these. That goes for BLM and Trump.\n\n&gt; When shits hits the fan, we become defensive and protective of ourselves.\n\nYou will. I won't.\n\n&gt; Read a book on two on unpredictability and false sense of intelligence. You could use it right now. Bitch.\n\nIntelligence? You are a pesemistic cunt, that's all.

You know your way around politics and your arguments are sound. Are you an international relations student by any chance?\n\nI agree with what you've said if you look it purely from the point of view of politics. A small fyi: I used insults only for the sake of continuity. Also, because this is reddit and I don't want to invest myself in having a thought through argumentation if the other guy might be an asshole. I'd never use them if we'd be having a real, long discussion about the issue. I guess we're going to have one right now and I'll stop.\n\nNevertheless, here's my rebuttal.\n\n**Cyclic nationalism** - I'll partly give you this one on the basis of definition. Yes, economic and political cycles aren't happening in fixed cycles but they do occur within a margin of error. I remember reading a research on this one while getting my bachelors degree years ago. It stated that economic cycles of western countries are somewhere between 7-11 years. During those cycles, monetary policy is adjusted (lowered interest rates, increased money supply, etc), fiscal policies follow shortly after, and then social policies are affected which determines whether nation becomes more open or closed (or something along these lines). I'll try to find it because it was an interesting read.\n\n**Fighting nationalism** - It's not about being a coward. It's all about the general stance of the majority of population. You can't fight what people think and the US proved that (in a way). Again, I'd love to end it but I see this issue every day while dealing with my clients. I deal with both, locals and foreigners, ranging from NGO's, 2 large student unions and SME's. In total, there are about 100 accounts representing A LOT of people. Students are by large pro liberal values. Older people are becoming increasingly nationalistic. 50+ years old were the first ones, 35-50 followed and now it's slowly happening to young adults. Students will fight it the most but they will follow.\n\nPolitically, I cannot fight your arguments because I'm not following whatever is happening in each party. You're most probably right with your facts. However, from the point of view of perceived value and economics in general, people are beginning to doubt the effectiveness of current establishment. Central Europe will be the last one to be affected that's for sure, but read a few studies on SME opinions on the availability of credit, competitiveness, and procurement. EU is in a poor shape when you look at these issues altogether and it will be worse given the uncertainty placed by Brexit and US elections will influence regime changes throughout the EU. It's a real threat and I've been told by a few friends from a Ministry of Foreign Affairs some countries have included rising nationalism as their top threats. Don't cite me on this one because I can't give you proof but I'm almost certain it's true because all other information I was told was true.\n\n**Understanding people** - While your response is proportional to my half-assed argument, your answer is not really valid because you didn't cover how people from older generations are feeling. Moreover, how older people feel in the periphery of the EU - Eastern Europe and the Baltic States, Great Britain, Italy. Just imagine these people seeing their countries being ruined by faulty reforms. Top it all off with austerity measures. There were numerous reports that austerity measures will not work but the political cost was too high to cancel it. Manufacturing and agriculture sectors were significantly affected and people were losing their jobs. Yes, countries should have been more prudent in adapting their businesses but it doesn't matter. The same thing happened in the US. Old people won't get reeducated and you have to live with it. It's wrong, but it's life. Once we have a rust belt of the EU (I think that was the correct term), and it's slowly but surely happening already, expect increased levels of nationalism and how it was better in the old times. South Park has a great take on this one in their latest season.\n\n**Me being pessimistic** - I've studied a great deal and directly dealt with how the EU and, subsequently, my home State functions. It's not pretty. Yes, my business is doing very good and it has outlasted other companies that started at almost the same time as me. However, I am a member of multiple chambers of commerce's and we talk about these issues. General outlook is rather pessimistic and people are getting hints of nationalism while sipping whiskey haha. We're trying to figure out what the fuck we should be doing to mitigate this and right now we don't have a working plan but there's still enough time to make one and our government is oblivious. What I understood from other chamber members and my foreign accounts, they have similar experiences.\n\nI think I've covered everything. I must note that I'll be away for, I think, 5 days and won't be able to make long responses. Let me know your thoughts about my comment.","link_id":"t3_5c6xl2"}
