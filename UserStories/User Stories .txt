Our first user story involves the academic researcher. This type of user would be interested in examining questions and trends related to group behavior and sentiments, and would thus also want to publish these results in academic journals. The key features that would be of relevance to this type of user would be a sorting and filtering function, text search, and analytics with data visualization. The visualization aspect of this portal would be especially useful since their main reason for using our platform is to examine and parse the trends, as opposed to wanting to examine individual comments.

Another user story involves a typical reddit user. This kind of user might want to filter search results by their favorite subreddit, so that they can look for popular keywords and sort comments based on number of upvotes, trending comments, etc. The most important features for the casual-redditor user would be the customizable search function and a comment view function. These features support the casual-redditor’s goal; to view individual comments returned by a customizable search.
